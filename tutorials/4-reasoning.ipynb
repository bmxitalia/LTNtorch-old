    "# Reasoning in LTN\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial defines and illustrates reasoning in LTN. It expects basic familiarity with other parts of LTN.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical Consequence in LTN\n",
    "\n",
    "The essence of reasoning is to determine if a closed formula $\\phi$ is the logical consequence of a knowledgebase $(\\mathcal{K},\\mathcal{G}_\\theta,\\Theta)$, where $\\mathcal{K}$ denotes the set of rules in the knowledgebase and $\\mathcal{G}_\\theta$ denotes a grounding that depends on some parameters $\\theta \\in \\Theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notion of logical consequence is adapted to Real Logic as follows:\n",
    "- In classical logic (boolean truth values), a formula $\\phi$ is the logical consequence of a knowledgebase $\\mathcal{K}$ if, for every interpretation (or model) that verifies the formulas in $\\mathcal{K}$, $\\phi$ is verified;\n",
    "- In Real Logic (fuzzy truth values), a formula $\\phi$ is the logical consequence of $(\\mathcal{K},\\mathcal{G}_\\theta,\\Theta)$ if, for every grounding $\\mathcal{G}_\\theta$ such that $\\mathrm{SatAgg}_{\\phi'\\in\\mathcal{K}}\\mathcal{G}_{\\theta}(\\phi') \\geq q $, we have $\\mathcal{G}_\\theta(\\phi)\\geq q$, where $q$ is a fixed satisfaction threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical consequence in Real Logic, by direct application of the definition, requires querying the truth value of $\\phi$ for a potentially infinite set of groundings.\n",
    "We therefore, in practice, consider the following directions:\n",
    "1. **Reasoning by brave inference**: one seeks to verify if for all the grounded theories that *maximally satisfy* $\\mathcal{K}$,\n",
    "    the grounding of $\\phi$ gives a truth value greater than a threshold $q$.\n",
    "    This often requires to check an infinite number of groundings.\n",
    "    Instead, one can approximate the search for these grounded theories by running the optimization w.r.t. the knowledgebase satisfiability multiple times and checking these groundings only.\n",
    "2. **Reasoning by refutation**:   one seeks to find out a counterexample of a grounding that does satisfy the knowledgebase $\\mathcal{K}$ but not the formula $\\phi$ (given the threshold $q$). A directed search for such examples is performed using a different learning objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we illustrate the second option, **reasoning by refutation**."

    "### Reasoning by Refutation\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to find a grounding that satisfies $\\mathcal{K}$ but does not satisfy $\\phi$. One can perform a directed search for such a counterexample by minimizing $\\mathcal{G}_\\theta(\\phi)$ while imposing a constraint that invalidates results where $\\mathcal{G}_\\theta(\\mathcal{K})<q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us define $\\mathrm{penalty}(\\mathcal{G}_\\theta,q)=\\begin{cases} c \\ \\text{if}\\ \\mathcal{G}_\\theta(\\mathcal{K}) < q,\\\\ 0 \\ \\text{otherwise},\\end{cases}$ where $c>1$ and set the objective:\n",

    "- If $\\mathcal{G}^\\ast(\\mathcal{K}) < q$ : Then for all $\\mathcal{G}_\\theta$, $\\mathcal{G}_\\theta(\\mathcal{K}) < q$ and therefore $(\\mathcal{K},\\mathcal{G}(\\ \\cdot\\mid \\theta), \\Theta)\\models_q\\phi$.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Soft constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as $\\mathrm{penalty}(\\mathcal{G}_\\theta,q)$ is a constant function on the continuous parts of its domain (zero gradients), it cannot be used directly as an objective to reach via gradient descent optimization. Instead, one should approximate the penalty with a soft constraint.\n",
    "\n",

    "- When $\\mathcal{G}_\\theta(\\mathcal{K}) < q$, the penalty is linear in $(q-\\mathcal{G}_\\theta(\\mathcal{K}))$ with a slope of $\\beta$.\n",
    "Setting $\\beta$ high, the gradients for $\\mathcal{G}_\\theta(\\mathcal{K})$ will be high in absolute value if the knowledgebase in not satisfied; the minimizer will prioritize increasing the satisfaction of the knowledgebase.\n",
    "- When $\\mathcal{G}_\\theta(\\mathcal{K}) > q$, the penalty is a negative exponential that converges to $-\\alpha$.\n",
    "Setting $\\alpha$ low but non zero ensures that, while the penalty plays an insignificant role when the knowledgebase is satisfied, the gradients do not vanish."
